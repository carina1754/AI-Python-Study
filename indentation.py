# Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs; indentation) at the beginning of the logical line is used to determine the
# indentation level of the logical line, which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements.
# This means that statements which go together must have the same indentation.
# Each such set of statements is called a ‘block’.

# How to indent: Use four spaces for indentation. This is the official Python language recommendation.
# Use Code/Reform Code (Ctrl+Alt+L) in PyCharm.

i = 5
#   print('Value is', i)
print('I repeat, the value is', i)

# This program causes an error.
